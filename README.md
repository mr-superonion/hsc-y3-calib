This repository contains open-source python software that provides the weight and calibration factors associated with the three-year (S19A) shape catalog from the HSC SSP survey (catalog description, catalog paper, simulation paper). The software is available for use under a BSD 3-clause license contained in the file LICENSE.md.

Currently the script gen_hsc_calibrations.py is set up to read in a FITS catalog containing the outputs from Rubinâ€™s LSST Science Pipelines, including re-Gaussianization shape measurements and cmodel magnitudes and errors, and produce a catalog with the additional quantities used for ensemble weak lensing shear estimation. (The contents of utilities.py and of data/ are accessed by gen_hsc_calibrations.py, but users need not interact with them directly.) For information about dependencies, command-line arguments, and memory usage, please read the docstring for gen_hsc_calibrations.py; the docstring will also be output to the terminal if you call the script without any arguments.
